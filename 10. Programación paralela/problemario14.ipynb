    "## Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is said to be _concurrent_ if it may have more than one active execution context — more than one “thread of control”. Concurrency has at least three important motivations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _To capture the logical structure of a problem._ Many programs, particularly servers and graphical applications, must keep track of more than one largely independent “task” at the same time. Often the simplest and most logical way to structure such a program is to represent each task with a separate thread of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _To exploit extra processors, for speed._ Long a staple of high-end servers and supercomputers, multiple processors have recently become ubiquitous in desktop and laptop machines. To use them effectively, programs must generally be written (or rewritten) with concurrency in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _To cope with separate physical devices._ Applications that run across the Internet or a more local group of machines are inherently concurrent. Likewise, many embedded applications―the control systems of a modern automobile, for example―often have separate processors for each of several devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we use the word _concurrent_ to characterize any system in which two or more tasks may be underway (at an unpredictable point in their execution) at the same time. Under this definition, coroutines are not concurrent, because at any given time, all but one of them is stopped at a well-known place. A concurrent system is _parallel_ if more than one task can be physically active at once; this requires more than one processor. The distinction is purely an implementation and performance issue: from a semantic point of view, there is no difference between true parallelism and the “quasiparallelism” of a system that switches between tasks at unpredictable times. A parallel system is _distributed_ if its processors are associated with people or devices that are physically separated from one another in the real world. Under these definitions, “concurrent” applies to all three motivations above. “Parallel” applies to the second and third; “distributed” applies to only the third.\n",

    "The speed of a program is the time it takes the program to execute.

    "Numerical integration is a method of computing an approximation of the area under the curve of a function, especially when the exact integral cannot be solved. For example, the value of the constant $\\pi$ can be defined by the following integral:\n",

    "However, rather than solve this integral exactly, we can approximate the solution by use of numerical integration. The following C code is an implementation of the numerical integration midpoint rectangle rule to solve the integral just shown. To compute an approximation of the area under the curve, we must compute the area of some number of rectangles (`num_rects`) by finding the midpoint (`mid`) of each rectangle and computing the height of that rectangle (`height`), which is simply the function value at that midpoint. We add together the heights of all the rectangles (`sum`) and, once computed, we multiply the sum of the heights by the width of the rectangles (`width`) to determine the desired approximation of the total area (`area`) and the value of $\\pi$.\n",
